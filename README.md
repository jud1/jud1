### About Me
I’m a Front-End and Full-Stack Developer with around 10 years of experience, focused on UI/UX, React, Node.js, and modern JavaScript frameworks.  
Based in Chile, currently planning to study Japanese and open to future IT opportunities in Japan.  

Most of my work revolves around building and maintaining **self-service and contracting flows**, integrating **custom API solutions** that make these processes more efficient.  
I also work on **personalization features** for public websites, improving the user experience based on customer data and context.  

I believe in writing maintainable code, designing clear data flows, and collaborating closely with designers and back-end teams to deliver reliable solutions.

- Currently developing enterprise dashboards and e-commerce systems for major clients (Entel Empresas, Chile).  
- Learning Japanese (beginner) and improving English communication (B1+/B2).  
- Interested in UI/UX design systems, React performance, and scalable Node.js backends.  
- Open to collaboration, mentoring, and cross-cultural projects.  
- Career goal: relocate to Japan and work in a multicultural IT environment.
